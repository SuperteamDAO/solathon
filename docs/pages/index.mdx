receiver = PublicKey("B3BhJ1nvPvEhx3hq3nfK8hx4WYcKZdbhavSobZEA44ai")
amount = 10000 # This is the amount in lamports

instruction = transfer(
    from_public_key=sender.public_key,
    to_public_key=receiver, 
    lamports=amount
)
transaction = Transaction(instructions=[instruction], signers=[sender])

result = client.send_transaction(transaction)
print(result)
```
</Code>
